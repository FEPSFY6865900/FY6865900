      <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
      Milankovich Cycles (named after the Serbian astronomer Milutin Milancovic), is a theory how the earth's
      orbit and tilt can influence climate changes over long periods of time. Whilst Milankovich cycles are mainly
      affected by the Sun and Moon's gravitational forces, other planets cannot be ignored Planet's such as
      Jupiter and Saturn, due to their massive sizes, exert significant gravitational forces that can change the 
      orbits and tilts of smaller bodies in the solar system, including Earth.
    </p>
  </section>

      <h3>Main</h3>
    <p>
      Milankovitch cycles help us a lot to understand long-term climate changes. There are three factors that 
      influence these cycles drastically, these are eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession. Each of these 
      factors helps explain how the cycles affect the distribution and intensity of solar radiation that Earth 
      receives, which in turn impacts climate patterns. Eccentricity refers to the shape of Earth's orbit around 
      the Sun, which changes from nearly circular to more elliptical over about 100,000 years. When the orbit 
      is more elliptical, the distance from the Sun varies greatly between aphelion (the farthest point) and 
      perihelion (the closest point), affecting seasonal temperatures. During times of high eccentricity, 
      summers in the Northern Hemisphere can be cooler, which may increase the amount of ice sheets created 
      and so therefore lead to glacial periods. Axial tilt, or obliquity, describes the angle of Earth's 
      tilt, which ranges from 22.1 to 24.5 degrees over a cycle of roughly 41,000 years. A larger axial 
      tilt results in more extreme seasonal differences, causing hotter summers and colder winters. On 
      the other hand, a smaller tilt leads to milder seasons. This constant change has a significant impact 
      on the climate, since higher summer temperatures can increase the rate of ice melting and cooler 
      winters can help with ice sheet growth. Precession involves the wobble of Earth's rotational axis and 
      occurs over a cycle of about 26,000 years. This wobble affects when different seasons on earth occur 
      based on Earth's position in its orbit. For instance, if summer is at the point where the Earth’s 
      orbit is closest to the sun (perihelion), the Northern Hemisphere experiences warmer summers, which 
      can result in increased ice melt and more climate shifts.For example, the relationship between 
      eccentricity and axial tilt can create various climate scenarios.

  <section id="Gravitational Interactions">
      <h3>Gravitational Interactions</h3>
    <p>
      Milankovitch cycles are mainly affected by the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon, but the gravity 
      from other planets, especially the gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, also has a big impact on these 
      cycles. 
      
      Gravitational Influences: 
      
      The gas giants have strong gravitational forces that can disturb 
      the orbits of smaller objects in the solar system, including Earth. These interactions can cause 
      changes in Earth's orbit, such as its shape, tilt, and wobble. For example, when planets align in 
      certain ways, it can either boost or reduce the effects of Milankovitch cycles, which might affect 
      when and how intense climate changes occur. 
      
      Resonance Effects: 
      Planetary resonance happens when two or more planets influence each other's orbits through regular 
      gravitational pulls, often leading to stronger effects on their orbital path. For instance, Jupiter 
      and Saturn's orbits are in sync, Jupiter and Saturn have a 5:2 orbital resonance, meaning that for 
      every five orbits Jupiter completes around the Sun, Saturn completes roughly two. This resonance 
      can cause long-term changes in Earth's orbital features (axial tilt, change in eccentricity)  
      affecting the patterns of climate change. 
      
      Chaotic Dynamics: 
      
      The interactions among multiple planets can create chaos in the solar system's behavior. 
      Research by Laskar and Robutel in 1993 showed that even minor gravitational shifts from giant 
      planets could lead to major changes in Earth's orbit over millions of years. This makes it harder 
      to predict Milankovitch cycles and shows the importance of looking at the whole solar system when 
      trying to find a  climate trend.

  <section id="Key Research Findings">
      <h3>Key Research Findings</h3>
    <p>
      Multiple studies have shown strong evidence that other planets impact Earth's Milankovitch cycles. 
      Laskar and Robutel (1993) conducted a study on the chaotic movements within the solar system, 
      which showed that gravitational interactions between planets can cause significant changes in 
      orbital movements over time. Their numerical simulations indicated that even small disturbances 
      could build up, leading to large and major shifts in Earth's climate over long geological periods. 
      Laskar (2004) investigated the solar system's long-term stability, suggesting that the gravitational 
      pull from the giant planets can influence the stability of Earth's orbit. He discovered that these 
      interactions could cause changes in Earth's axial tilt and eccentricity, which in turn affect 
      Milankovitch cycles. Hinse et al. (2010) specifically studied how Jupiter and Saturn's gravitational 
      forces impact the inner solar system. They found that the gravitational effects of these massive 
      planets could alter the orbits of smaller celestial bodies, including Earth, potentially affecting 
      Milankovitch cycles and climate patterns. Climate Modulation: Gonzalez and Thiemann (2017) looked 
      into how the gravitational forces from other planets and the Moon interact with Earth's climate. 
      Their findings suggested that these forces could play a role in determining the timing and intensity 
      of Milankovitch cycles, influencing the advance and retreat of ice ages. In their book Solar System 
      Dynamics, Murray and Dermott (1999) offered a detailed look at the dynamics within the solar system. 
      They talked about how gravitational interactions between planets can lead to long-term changes in 
      their orbits, which may indirectly affect Earth's climate by different Milankovitch cycles. The way 
      celestial bodies interact is really complicated and can result in different climate effects. For 
      instance, the influence of Milankovitch cycles can be altered by other planets, creating feedback 
      loops that impact Earth's climate in ways we still don't completely grasp.The gravitational pull 
      from other planets can either boost or lessen the impact of Milankovitch cycles. As an example, if 
      a large planet is at a position that increases Earth’s axial tilt, it may cause more extreme seasonal 
      changes. On the other hand, if these interactions decrease the axial tilt, it could lessen the climate 
      change effects linked to glacial and interglacial periods. Feedback Loops: Changes in Earth's climate 
      due to Milankovitch cycles can also affect the orbits of other celestial bodies. If ice sheets now start 
      to grow by a huge factor, it could change how Earth’s mass is distributed, which may influence 
      gravitational interactions and lead to more climate changes. To make good and accurate future climate 
      predictions, it’s crucial to understand how other planets affect Earth’s Milankovitch cycles. As more 
      research is conducted about the solar system's dynamics, taking into account these complex relationships 
      will be key to fully understanding future climate scenarios.
